        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I love a delicious breakfast recipe like huevos rancheros. It has all the components of a satisfying meal, protein from the eggs, carbs from the torllas, and good veggies form the homemade salsa. With some sliced avocados and cotija cheese and you've got one delicious plate of food.</p>

                <li>3 plum potatoes</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li><span>&#188;</span> teaspoon salt</li>
                <li><span>&#189;</span> teaspoon paprika</li>

                <li><span>&#188;</span> cup chicken stock or water</li>
                <li><span>&#188;</span> cup chopped cilantro</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of fresh lime juice</li>
                <p>For Eggs and Tortillas</p>
                <li>3 tablespoons of frying oil</li>
                <li>8 corn tortillas</li>
                <li>8 fried eggs</li>
                <li>for serving: cotija cheese, avocados, radishes, hot sauce</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium pot or skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add in jalapenos, onions, tomatoes, garlic, salt, paprika and dried oregano. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until onions and peppers soften.</li>
                <li>Add chicken stock and cook for another 10 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Using a blender, blend the mixture until it reaches the consistency you like.</li>
                <li>Stir in the cilantro and lime juice, taste and season with more salt if necessary. Cover and set aside.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For Eggs and Tortillas</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. This is to keep the eggs and tortillas warm since you'll likely be working in batches. If you're making this recipe for only 1 or 2 people, preheating the oven isn't really necessary.</li>
                <li>In a small or medium skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Working in batches, lightly fry the tortillas for about 15 seconds per side until they've softened and are beginning to get some crispy edges. Transfer to a baking sheet, blot tortillas with a paper towel to remove any excess oil and place in oven to keep warm. Repeat until all tortillas have been softened and lightly fried.</li>
                <li>In the same skillet, fry the eggs using the leftover oil (add more if necessary) without flipping until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny. Transfer to baking sheet in oven and repeat until all eggs are cooked. Slide 1 egg over each tortilla; top with ranchero sauce and sprinkle with cheddar and Monterey Jack.</li>
                <li>To assemble, place two tortillas on a large plate and top each with a fried egg. Top with salsa, cotija cheese, avocados, radishes and more hot sauce</li>
            </ol>
